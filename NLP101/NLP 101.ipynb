        "# ContextEdge is **Deloitte's integrated toolkit for Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that delivers sophisticated text analytics, advanced context analytics, and leading edge semantic signals analysis solutions for our clients, harnessing potentially valuable insights otherwise undiscovered. The codebase is meant to be used by data scientists as a portable set of accelerators that represents the 70-80% initial solution you need to begin analyzing text for client projects.\n",
        "# \n",
        "# It is designed to help you as a data scientist or developer quickly ingest and analyze a set of documents **_on day one_** so you can spend less time wrangling texxt data and more time making your models more insightful! It uses commons packages such as `sklearn`, `gensim`, and `nltk` that you are familiar with, but packaged into smart workflows as a series of functions that enable you to quickly execute the typical NLP project.\n",
